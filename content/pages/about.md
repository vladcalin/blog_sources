## About me

My name is Calin Vlad and I write Python code for living.

**Why Python you ask?** 

Well, long story short, Python allows you to focus on the problem that must be solved and invest the
time you would need writing the same thing in another programming language in the actual problem solving. I strongly believe 
that, despite the fact that Python allows one to write an application faster, it requires a lot more discipline in code writing
than any other language :) (not respecting the language's guidelines can easily turn a nice codebase into a unmainainable chunk
of random bytes). Although I am a Python fanboy, I am flexible in choosing the right language for the problem I have to solve 
(the programming language is just a tool after all).

**Favorite stuff** 

I sure do enjoy spending (a lot of ) time on [Reddit](https://reddit.com) and reading about topics that are
relevant to the current state of the technology. I like to explore new things and think big :) . I am interested in data
analysis, big data, distributed systems, information security and (recently) in machine learning (especially neural networks).
