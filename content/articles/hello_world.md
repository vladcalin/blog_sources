There is no secret that having a blog is no big deal. Nowdays, everybody can create and host
a blog with ease. So I though... why shouldn't I have a blog?

I always wanted to write about different things that bug or incite me, write a couple
of words about some interesting things I do or see other people do, offer some tips
about the problems that every programmer once had, etc.

Over the past few days, I searched a method to create a free blog without any major
complications and drama. I researched a little and I tried some of the most popular
choices:

- using Blogger (Google's platform for blogging)
- using Wordpress
- using Jekyll
- using Pelican
